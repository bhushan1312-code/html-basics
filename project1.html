        The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India organised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).[1] Founded in 2007, the league features ten state or city-based franchise teams.[2] The IPL is the most popular and richest cricket league in the world and is held between March and May.
         It has an exclusive window in the Future Tours Programme of the International Cricket Council (ICC), resulting in fewer international cricket tours occurring during the IPL seasons.[3] It is also the most viewed sports competition in India
